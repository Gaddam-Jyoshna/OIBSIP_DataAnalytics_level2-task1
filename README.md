PROJECT : 🏡 Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

✅ Level 2- Task 1

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline to predict housing prices based on various features. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization 

using Python and Scikit-Learn.

📂 Dataset Used

Housing.csv: Contains numerical and categorical features related to residential properties and their selling prices.

🚀 Key Concepts & Workflow

Data Collection

Obtained a dataset with relevant numerical and categorical features for housing prices.

Data Exploration and Cleaning


Handled missing values

Converted categorical data using one-hot encoding

Explored dataset structure and statistics

Feature Selection


Selected features that influence house prices

Dropped unnecessary columns

Model Training


Implemented Linear Regression using scikit-learn

Trained on 80% of the data

Model Evaluation

Evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score

Visualization

Plotted Actual vs Predicted house prices to visually assess model performance

🧠 Libraries Used

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

📊 Evaluation Metrics

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared (R²) Score

📌 Results

The model successfully predicted housing prices with reasonable accuracy using linear regression. The performance was evaluated with standard regression metrics and illustrated visually.
